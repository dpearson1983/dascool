DAvid'S COsmOlogy Library

## Introduction
Over the years, I have found the need to compute many cosmological quantities, from comoving distances to no-wiggle power spectra. As
I do most of my coding in C++, I found that there wasn't really a cosmology library available that had all the things I needed, so I
started to put my own library together. This is an updated version of the patchwork library I had been putting together for several 
years now by just adding new functionality as needed. Hopefully this will be useful to someone else.
